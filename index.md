# Welcome

My name is Ji hann Hong.

I am a software engineer with 3+ years of experience in developing secure, high-performance applications using Java and Python. My career's domain is currently specialized in the security aspects of software, from PKI broadly to debugging Java runtime environments for TLSv1.3 cipher suites specifically.

## Featured Experience

### Security Stack in Server Applications

In experience with my company's development lifecycle through the lens of security, I've had to encounter:

  - Threatmodeling
  - PKI deployment and management
  - Vulnerability detection, management, and mitigation
  - Incident Response
  - Security-specific applications development

### AI Prompt Engineering Proficiency

Given the advent of ChatGPT, my experience with this technology has been increasing my capabilities to learn and apply my development skills beyond the old processes of search and interpretation. With ChatGPT, I have been able to deploy this website.

My exprience with prompt engineering has been improving my workflow for building this website such as:

  - Conveying what technologies can deliver a website for free and for low effort
  - Conveying an example of deploying a website with GitHub Pages
  - How to safely interface personal identifiable information such as contact forms and email obfuscation
  - How to find modern web standards of design
