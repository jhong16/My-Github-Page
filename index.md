# About

My name is Ji hann Hong.

I have been a software engineer since 2021. I began in the security domain, building applications for directory services, vulnerability lifecycles, and primarily, authentication services. Over time, I have broadened my interests into full stack development, mainly through self-exploration after work and exercises like homelabbing. My goal is to share my latest interests and work in building and using various aspects of AI applications including domain knowledge modeling and better domain knowledge retrieval.

## Featured Experience

### Security Stack in Server Applications

In experience with my company's development lifecycle through the lens of security, I've had to encounter:

  - Threatmodeling
  - PKI deployment and management
  - Vulnerability detection, management, and mitigation
  - Incident Response
  - Security-specific applications development

### This Website!

I developed and tweaked this website following the documentation of Github Pages as deployment tooling, Jekyll as front end tooling,  Github as a hosting and infrastructure, and Cloudflare as domain name services. This served as an exercise to:

  - Use LLMs to get up to speed on front end development
  - Learn some of the backbone of the internet
  - Create a portfolio of my work
  - Use LLMs to learn modern standards for web design
    - Cross-apply security knowledge to hopefully obfuscate email from robot spam on the contact form

### AI Prompt Engineering Proficiency

Given the advent of ChatGPT, my experience with this technology has been increasing my capabilities to learn and apply my development skills beyond the old processes of search and interpretation.

My exprience with prompt engineering has been improving my workflow such as:

  - This website
  - My self-hosting journey (coming soon)
  - Natural language programming in general
