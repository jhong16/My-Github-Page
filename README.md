# My Github Page
My personal website hosted at [jihann.com](https://jihann.com).

This was an exercise and result of trying to host a decent website portfolio for software engineers.

Besides just using the basic tech stack:

- Cloudflare DNS
- Github Pages
- Jekyll

I've also added some modern web ergonomics

- [X] Sticky Navigation Bar
- [X] Dark Mode
- [X] Mobile Brower/Scrolling Support
- [X] Blog Card Widget
- [X] Contact Card Widget
- [X] Resume Widget

which for most portfolios is simple, lovable, and complete.
